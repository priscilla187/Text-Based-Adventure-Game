# Text-Based-Adventure-Game
A Python-based text adventure game inspired by Resident Evil, developed as part of my AI-driven software bootcamp. This project showcases my ability to design and implement gameplay mechanics, emphasizing interactive storytelling and object-oriented programming.

## How to Play:
1. Download the repository.
2. Run `main.py` to start the game.
3. If you can't hear the music after starting the game, try installing Pygame by running `pip install pygame` in the terminal.
4. For an optimal gameplay experience, head east or south first, and leave the west for last. This will allow you to defeat all enemies before collecting the key.

## Files:
- `character.py`: Defines the characters in the game.
- `item.py`: Defines the items available in the game.
- `main.py`: Main file to run the game.
- `room.py`: Handles room management and interactions.
- `eerie_music.mp3`: Background music for a more immersive gameplay experience.
